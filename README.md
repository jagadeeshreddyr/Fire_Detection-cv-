# Fire Detection
![A test image](fire.jpeg) 
> - The main aim of the project is to Detect the fire using Image Processing (cv2).
> - To show how image processing is rapid (x10 faster) compare to real time sensors
> - I Used a pretrained model i.e haar cascade algorithm to detect fire (path = xml/fire_detection.xml)
> - Code includes Blynk app(iot) to give alert when fire is detected which will be connected through wifi. 
> - Hardwares like smoke and fire sensors were integrated with Esp32 (Î¼-controller), to show difference between sensors vs image processing. 
> - To run the code you can install conda yml file 
> - To test just place match stick fire infront of camera.
